Here's a list of coding languages I have learned:
- Java (I'm most familiar with Java)
- Python (I'm excited to learn more this semester)
- C (I want to get into C++ as well)
- Assembly Language (This was brutal and I'm glad it's over)

My favorite line of code is:
'''
System.out.println("Hello World!");
'''
